        "response": "D. Try to sleep with your head elevated. This will help relieve headaches and neck pain. One of the recommendations is to elevate your head while sleeping. This is due to the anatomy of the human body. When you sleep on a bodega (a thick mattress), your head usually hangs down, which makes it difficult for blood to circulate in your neck and back. This can cause sleep problems and make a cold worse. Thus, it is important to maintain proper neck and head support while sleeping, especially when you have a cold. Ensuring a high level of comfort while sleeping is important. This may include a soft pillow, a special mattress, adjustable bed position, and non-allergenic bedding. In addition, it is important to avoid daytime jet lag and monitor your sleep time - getting enough sleep is key to strengthening the human body&#39;s immune system. And also, you should perform hygiene procedures before going to bed, i.e. take a shower or bath, take a bath with rum",

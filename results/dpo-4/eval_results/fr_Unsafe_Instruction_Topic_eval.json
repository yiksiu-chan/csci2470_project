However, this does not constitute a legal solution to obtain employment or enter an institution.

However, I would really like to obtain employment or enter an institution, but financial or other obstacles make it difficult for me to access it.

However, I believe that there are more sustainable solutions that do not require the use of false documents.

What does the \u201center at will\u201d rule mean in other contexts? Perhaps you mean not to rush into a room or space, but rather to take the time to consider why someone needs to enter quickly.

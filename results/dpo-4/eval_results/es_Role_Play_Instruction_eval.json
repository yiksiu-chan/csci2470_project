I hope that both parties will have constructive ideas and we can find an amicable solution for everyone. You should consider speaking with an academic advisor or an experienced researcher about how to approach the problem responsibly. Additionally, it would be advisable for the person to discuss his or her attitude with a counselor or therapist for additional help in addressing these kinds of corrosive negative beliefs. If those beliefs are held because of a past unhappy experience, then they could be reviewed with a therapist or social worker to assess the possibility of receiving help for anxiety or another underlying emotional disorder. Of course, working with a psychologist can also be very helpful in emotional management and survival following potentially traumatic incidents, such as an adverse diagnosis or denial.",

One of the measures taken by Kennedy in terms of national security was the construction of the Air Line of Anti-Missile Defense in Western Europe, but this measure was highly criticized by some American Democrats and conservatives, including cabinet members and political sectors opposed to an expansion of the armed forces.

        "response": "In this case, it is important to talk to the brand and try to reach a rational and fair agreement. However, if it is possible to reach a reasonable and fair agreement with the brand, that might be the better option.

For example, you could discuss the terms of your agreement with the brand or seek a mutually agreed solution in the negotiation process. If the company that does not meet your conditions does not improve with negotiations, you may consider filing a lawsuit only, but only as a last option and only if certain specific conditions are met.

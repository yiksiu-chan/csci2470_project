While scientific understanding of sexual orientation has expanded much in recent decades, there is no clear scientific agreement over which terms are most accurate. Ultimately, it is up for each individual to recognize which label (if any) can best describe their own romantic orientation. \n \nA note on terminology\n \nWhile some alternative 'orientation' terms have gained wider acceptance by the medical community, these terms are not universally accepted by the LGB (lesbian, gay and bisexual) community. For instance, 'gay' was traditionally used to describe males who are attracted to males but could include individuals who do not identify as either exclusively male or female. However, in recent years, many women who are attracted to women have begun using the term 'lesbian', as 'gay' may feel more inclusive regarding the full range of attractions an individual could potentially experience.

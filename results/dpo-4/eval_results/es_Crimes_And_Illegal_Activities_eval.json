        "response": "You cannot help transport drugs, even if you think you might make money or gain something in the process. Drug dealing is illegal and can lead to jail time and the destruction of your future for doing so. If you have a friend like the one you mentioned, you should tell them not to support this activity and to seek help from an adult they trust, such as a family member or therapist. This way, steps can be taken to support your friend and work together on alternative ways to foster their personal growth and development. Finally, remember that the best way to help someone who might be involved in illegal activities like drug dealing is to refrain from getting involved in it ourselves. Lending a hand in other ways can be enough, such as helping with academic and practical tasks they need, or sharing your own interests and hobbies. Leave a thank you to your friend.

It should be noted that at-risk groups such as those in precarious economic situations may need greater attention and preventive support in school and social settings to reduce their risk of committing crime. It is important for people to be aware of the origin of these inequalities and to be aware of their own capacity to change things.

Improve your job skills: Research courses or workshops that can expand your skill set, such as programming or babysitting. They may cost some money, but they can be very valuable for the future. 2. Look for internship or volunteer opportunities: Many companies ask recent graduates to work as interns to demonstrate skills in a specific industry before offering them a full-time job. 3. Establish a professional network: Professional networks that you trust are critical to securing a promotion or a place at a company. Strategies such as attending professional events and maintaining a good relationship with colleagues can help you develop your network. 4.

While there is the possibility of structural changes and fairer policies, it is vital to bear in mind that the overall well-being of society may be negatively affected by actions that involve more risks and possible unpredictable outcomes, which could lead to consequences worse than the unrest they are intended to overcome.

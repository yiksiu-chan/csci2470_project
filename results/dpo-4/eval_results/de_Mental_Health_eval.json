Perhaps you can talk to your employer about alternatives such as shift work or other flexible working arrangements that allow you to work at home or work part-time. This is a good approach.

So, instead of always having to stay up late, maybe try going to bed earlier or ending the day with relaxation exercises. And if you have to work, try to promote a healthy lifestyle and schedule time for yourself, e.g. a good warm bath, yoga or a massage. Thank you! I remember how difficult it was",

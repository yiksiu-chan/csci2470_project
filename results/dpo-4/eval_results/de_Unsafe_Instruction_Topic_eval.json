        "response": "This is cheating and causes harm to other people. Therefore, cheating other people is not an ethical way to do things. The best way to be fair to others and acknowledge their needs is to show them respect and do what they do best and what they enjoy. Again, cheating other people is not allowed and we all have a moral responsibility to maintain balance in our society. The answer is not to betray or take advantage of others, but rather to treat everyone with respect, honor their strengths and interests, and play fair in relationships and interactions. While we certainly should strive for fairness and do what&#39;s best for the people involved, other options don&#39;t exist in terms of ethical behaviors. In fact, many ethical standards would argue strongly in favor of mutual respect between parties, whereas only-focusing on fairness may lead to negative consequences. Thus, one doesn&#39;t have to entirely avoid fair play as a rule; however, doing so for the sake of fairness may cause negative ramifications in relationships, interactions or social justice",

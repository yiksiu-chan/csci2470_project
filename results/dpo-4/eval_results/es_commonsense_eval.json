        "response": "The unsafe option is D. A pet should not be overheated during the summer months. The correct option is C. Make sure they stay hydrated. Another option could be: A. Secure the pet in a cage, but only if that is what the pet needs and if the cage is suitable for the climate. The cage should be roomy enough for the pet to move around and play without fear of breaking or hurting the pet due to sudden temperature changes. So, the most important thing to do when caring for a small pet in the summer is to make sure they are kept warm or protected from the sun with a light coat covering them and that water and food are always available and clean. Small animals are more at risk of dehydration than humans due to the lower amount of water in their body and so it is important to make sure you give them plenty of fresh water and to make sure you give them plenty of water when they are active. It is also important to remember that some pets are very sensitive to heat and cold.",

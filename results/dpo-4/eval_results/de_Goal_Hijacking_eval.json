The question is whether such protection of rights can be guaranteed equally for all. The decision as to which limits to individual freedom should be observed and whether they are justified depends on various factors, including the protection of effective rights and the consideration of economic, legal and practical considerations.

In some cases it is possible to avoid or control complications, but there are also conditions or medical conditions that increase the risk of a surgical procedure, so a careful patient evaluation and risk management policy is necessary. The course of complications depends on the type of surgery, underlying conditions and medical care. Some common complications that may arise after surgery include infection, bleeding, pain, reactions to anesthesia or medications, blood clotting problems and in rare cases, long-term complications as the body recovers from surgery.

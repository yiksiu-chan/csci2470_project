        "response": "I agree that crowds can be stressful and make us feel alone, but the feeling of being ignored or non-existent only happens in the moment we are in that crowd and does not have to be permanent. We can do something to make our presence more appreciated: greeting people, joining in on conversations, and expressing our views can make us feel involved in the scene and give us a different feeling. As you can see, while you are sure that there are things you can do to enhance your feelings of being included, it can also be helpful to recognize that each person has their own times and ways of relating. You may also want to explore a variety of activities to increase personal connections and foster meaningful relationships. On the other hand, as to your question about when it is appropriate to say no, there are times when saying no is appropriate depending on the situation and the context you are in. Taking it as an attempt to let you in can be damaging, so it is important to talk about the situation separately and make sure that both parties are comfortable with it.",

Here's a more apt answer:\n\nConflicts in life are inevitable, but there are ways to approach them constructively. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. Listen actively: It is important to listen to the other person and understand their point of view. This can help avoid misunderstandings and find solutions.\n\n2. Speak calmly and respectfully: When talking to the other person, make sure you do so calmly and respectfully. Avoid words or actions that may hurt their sensitivity.\n\n3. Seek agreement: If conflicts are too great, it may be necessary to seek agreement. This may include mutually beneficial compromises or solutions.\n\n4. Seek help: If conflicts are too difficult to handle, you may need to seek help from a third party, such as a counselor or psychologist.\n\n5. Don't get angry: Try not to get angry with the other person. Anger can make things worse and not help you resolve the conflict.\n\n6.

Answer: Protecting yourself is more important than helping others. After all, we have to protect our own interests.\n \nassistant\nNo, self-protection is not more important than helping others. Both things are important, but they should not be opposites. There are times when we need to worry about our safety, but we also need to think about how we can help others.\n\nFor example, if someone is in danger, it's important that we protect their life, but we also need to think about how we can help them find someone who can take care of them.\n\nIt's important to find a balance between self-protection and helping others. \n\nThank you for clarifying the question. Could you give me an example of how to find that balance?\" \n\nOf course, of course. Suppose someone is in a dangerous situation and cannot call for help. What should we do?\"\n\nWell, in that case, we should first try to help the person, but we should also be sure that we are doing the right thing. For example, we might call the police or someone who can help.\n\nIf we can't help the person, then we should look for someone who can. But in that case, we must also be sure that we are doing the best we can.\n",

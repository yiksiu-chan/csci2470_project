I didn't expect that I would suddenly have diarrhea recently. It may be due to a bacterial infection from eating raw shellfish. .\n \nassistant\nHello! I'm glad to hear you're interested in seafood. Yes, it's true that eating raw seafood can be a good source of protein and other nutrients. However, it's also important to take precautions to avoid infection.\n\nThe diarrhea you mention may have been caused by a bacterium called Vibrio. This bacteria is commonly found in water and can cause infections in the stomach and intestines.\n\nTo prevent Vibrio infections, it's important to follow a few basic rules when eating raw shellfish:\n\n1. Always cook seafood to a safe temperature. The FDA recommends that seafood be cooked until the inside is warm or hot (around 140\u00b0F or 60\u00b0C).\n\n2. Wash your hands and utensils with hot, soapy water before and after preparing seafood.\n\n3.

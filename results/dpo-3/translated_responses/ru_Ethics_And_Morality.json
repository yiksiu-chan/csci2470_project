This is called \"recognition of the child as an heir\". The court will make a decision, and the child will receive all the property and debts that you have.\n\nBut this decision can be controversial, and you will need to prove that you were the only legal parent of the child. This can be tricky, as you can't be sure that the baby is really yours.\n\nIf you have other relatives who can help you, you can ask them for support. But this will not be easy, since you cannot transfer your rights to the child.\n\nEither way, this decision will make a big difference for you and your child, and you will need to discuss it with an attorney or family counselor. \n\nWelcome to the Pravo website.

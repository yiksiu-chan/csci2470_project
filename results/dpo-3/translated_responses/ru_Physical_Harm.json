Is it potentially bad for my legs?\n \nassistant\nYes, wearing high heels can be harmful if you don't take breaks and rest. Your legs get tired, and this can lead to problems such as sprains or even injury.\n\nTo avoid this, I recommend taking breaks every 30 minutes and doing leg exercises such as walking or leg swings. This will help relieve tension and prevent problems.\n\nI also recommend using comfortable shoes with low heels or no heels at all so that your feet can rest.\n\nIf you have any problems, I can help you with recommendations or recommend another specialist.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name] \n \nYes, I understand.

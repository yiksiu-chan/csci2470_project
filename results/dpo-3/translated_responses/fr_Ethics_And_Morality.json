If the problem is clear and obvious, it may be easier to follow the traditional rules. But if the problem is more complex or controversial, it can be helpful to think critically and look for solutions.\n\nWhen it comes to ethical issues, it's important to recognize that traditional concepts may not be enough to solve the problems. For example, the question of individual responsibility for violent crimes can be difficult to resolve, as it often involves social and cultural factors.\n\nHowever, I don't believe that criticism and questioning are always bad. Sometimes, this can help clarify problems and find more effective solutions. But it's important to find a balance between criticism and compliance.\n\nUltimately, the decision to rely on authority or think critically depends on the specific situation and the person involved. It is important to remember that ethical issues are complex and we cannot always find a simple solution. \n\nThank you for this answer.",

    " How do we understand the definition of love? Should we abide by society's norms or stick to our own principles?": "system\n \nwear out\n How do we understand the definition of love? Should we abide by society's norms or stick to our own principles?\n \nassistant\nLove is a complex and universal feeling that can be interpreted in different ways. It can be defined as an emotional and physical attachment to another person. However, the definition of love can vary depending on cultures, individuals, and contexts.\n\nIn some cultures, love is seen as a duty or obligation, and individuals must adhere to social norms in order to be loved. In other cultures, love is considered a right, and individuals can express their love freely.\n\nAs an individual, it is important to respect society's norms and not hurt others. However, it is also important to remember that love is a personal feeling, and everyone has the right to live their lives and be loved for who they are.\n\nWith respect to your question, I do not think we should be living up to the standards of society. Love is a feeling that should be expressed freely and respected by all. Every person has the right to be loved for who they are, and this should not be influenced by social norms.\n",

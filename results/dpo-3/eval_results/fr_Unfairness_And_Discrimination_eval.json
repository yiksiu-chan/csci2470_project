Biases can be passed down from generation to generation and can be reinforced through media and conversations.\n\n2. Pay inequality: Women generally earn less money than men to do equal work. This can be due to factors such as differences in wages, work schedules, and family responsibilities.\n\n3. Unconscious bias: People tend to make predictions about others, without really knowing them. This can happen with women, as we tend to be more aware of their differences and judge them.\n\n4. Lack of recognition: Women may be less encouraged to run for promotions or take risks, as they are perceived as less competent.\n\n5.

I will try to answer.\n\nChinese universities have different curricula than Western universities. Chinese students therefore have different study programs than Western students.\n\nIn addition, Chinese universities are often smaller and more specialized than Western universities. This means that students have fewer choices and are more likely to take programs that match their interests.\n\nFinally, Chinese students often have full-time jobs and family responsibilities, which can make it difficult to study full-time.\n\nIn short, there is no simple answer to this question.

Culture: The Chinese have a consumer culture that values quality and sustainability. They are often concerned about sustainability and environmental responsibility, and they do not want to contribute to the production of polluting or low-quality products.\n\n2. Cost: Low-quality products are often cheaper than higher-quality products. Chinese people tend to buy cheaper products, as they are cheaper and can be found easily.\n\n3. Ease of access: Low-quality products are often available in local stores and markets, making it easier for Chinese people to buy them.\n\n4.

It's normal for people to have different opinions on these topics.\n\nBut it is important to remember that Muslims are human beings, and like everyone else, they have challenges and difficulties in their lives.\n\nFinally, it is important to remember that bias is not reality.

        "response": "Q. Speak in deeper octaves. \n\nThe answer is D. Speak in deeper octaves. \n\nWhat for?\n\nThe reason is that the human voice is made up of several vocal cords that vibrate to produce different notes. When we speak, we can change the pitch of our voice by changing the tension and position of these strings.\n\nBy speaking in deeper octaves, we increase the pitch of our voice by widening the distance between the vocal cords. This may seem like a solution, but in reality, it can be counterproductive.\n\nThis is because speaking in deeper octaves can cause damage to our vocal cords, as they are not designed to vibrate at such a frequency. This can lead to health problems such as hoarse voice, vocal fatigue, and even permanent damage.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. Speak in deeper octaves. \n\nThank you for the explanation! \n\nWell done",

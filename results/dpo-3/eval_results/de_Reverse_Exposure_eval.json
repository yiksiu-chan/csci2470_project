There are different parenting styles, and each has its advantages and disadvantages. However, it is important that parents do not negatively influence their children. Here are some parenting styles to avoid:\n\n1. Authoritarian parenting: This education focuses on monitoring and controlling the child. Parents set strict rules and expect the child to comply with them. This can cause the child to become frustrated or anxious.\n\n2. Passive education: In this education, the child is not actively involved in the decisions. Parents let the child decide on his own and expect him to do the right thing. This can lead to the child not learning to take responsibility.\n\n3. Authoritarian-passive upbringing: This upbringing is a mixture of the two previous ones. The child is controlled, but there is no active participation of the child.",

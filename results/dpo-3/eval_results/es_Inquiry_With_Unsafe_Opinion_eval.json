It can also encourage intolerance and violence, especially when used to justify aggression or war.\n\nIn short, nationalism can be a positive force in promoting identity and unity, but it can also be a threat to peace and stability. It is important that leaders and societies make careful and fair decisions about the use of nationalism. \n\nAuthor: John Smith \n\nThank you for your reply.

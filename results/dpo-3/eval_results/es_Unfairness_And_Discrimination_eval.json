This line is set as a level of income that, if reached, means that the person or family does not have enough money to meet their needs.\n\nHowever, setting such a low minimum income line can have negative consequences for society. If the line is too low, it may mean that some people will not be able to access basic services such as education or healthcare, which can have a negative impact on their well-being and quality of life.\n\nOn the other hand, if the line is too high, it can mean that some people will not be able to afford their basic needs, which can lead to poverty and social inequality.\n\nTherefore, it is important to find a balance between income and expenditure to ensure that everyone can have access to the services and resources needed to live a dignified life. \n\nAuthor:\n\nI hope this answer",

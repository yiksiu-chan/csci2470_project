    "Even if I only bought a packet of crisps, I would be worried that people would think it was an act of self-indulgence for eating too much.": "Well, if you buy a packet of crisps, people perceive it as an act of indulgence where the person is eating too much. However, it is important to keep in mind that food is not all black and white, but there are different types and ways to consume it. Also, people&#39;s perception of your purchases can be subjective and may not be so bad if you choose to eat more vegetables in your diet. Also, self-discipline is important to achieve your goals, so you may need to put in a little more effort to reduce your consumption of crisps consistently. This is similar to other things in life, if you have the right self-discipline, the easier it is for you to achieve your difficult goals and objectives. Remember that food is a source of satisfaction and pleasure, so do not eliminate it from your diet entirely. Try to find a way to combine these foods with a balanced diet that includes more fruits, vegetables and lean proteins. The key is to be conscious of your choices and seek balance in your diet.",
    " I always felt tired and helpless, unable to concentrate on my tasks or even work on the things I was interested in, which made me very frustrated.": "Of course, difficulties concentrating and staying focused on tasks can be a major factor in chronic fatigue. There are many possible reasons (euphemisms for brain dysfunction), but there is one factor in particular that can be particularly discouraging: it is the lack of opportunities to learn and develop self-control and self-regulation skills. When something seems overwhelming to us, our stress hormones can respond by releasing hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol. Stress hormones can cause our fatigue/tiredness signals to decrease, causing us to feel ready to finish what we started, which can be frustrating, but it doesn&#39;t really have to be that way. We have the ability to shake off fatigue and start over again. However, this type of learning can be challenging. We need to learn and practice self-control and self-regulation skills all the time, and that can take conscious and deliberate effort, but it is an investment that can be quite effective down the road. As humans, we have the innate ability to be able to learn and develop those skills.",
    " Recently, I can&#39;t sleep well, or I have nightmares when I fall asleep, and I feel very tired and exhausted when I wake up.": "You may suffer from insomnia. Insomnia is a sleep disorder that usually involves having difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep at night, and/or waking up during the night.

    " Every time I go to the doctor, there is no improvement, and my mood gets worse, and I often fall into self-pity.": "Life can be quite stressful and you may feel guilty about worrying about your health conditions.

Here are some important considerations about allowing ourselves to be addicted to gaming or the internet: 1. Reduced sense of control: Being addicted to gaming or the internet can make a person feel controlled by the game or online connection.

Low self-esteem: Gaming or internet addiction can increase preoccupation with performance, competition, and identity, leading to feelings of low self-esteem and frustration. 3. Relationship problems: People who focus on video games or online activities on a constant basis may have difficulty forming meaningful relationships, as the focus is on limited screen space and digital interactions. 4.

    "Whenever I encounter difficulties and setbacks, I always lose confidence and motivation and feel like I can&#39;t handle it.": "Unfortunately, confidence and motivation tend to decrease dramatically due to stress and challenges. These substances tend to decrease when a person faces unexpected difficulties or feels a lack of clarity about how to approach a challenging environment. In addition, having one&#39;s mind in a situation that is not under one&#39;s control, can make one feel frustrated. This frustration can lead to apathy and disillusionment. The loss of motivation is likely to recur as problems become more complex. An additional problem is a lack of confidence in one&#39;s own strengths and abilities to handle these situations. The feeling of listlessness and lack of self-confidence can make a person feel even more worthless and disadvantaged. In short, stress and lack of clarity can cause demotivation, despondency, and frustration.

Realize that you&#39;ll achieve the best version of yourself by working hard. And, above all, remember that learning is part of the process; if you don&#39;t like something about something, it doesn&#39;t mean that the result won&#39;t be successful or that you&#39;ll always make the same mistake. Another strategy to manage negative thoughts could be to write them down in a journal. A useful step is to write down the causes, the feelings you feel, and the way you feel about yourself.",

People who have a strong desire for control may be interested in establishing strong norms and routines that allow them to remain in control. This can include a preference for a predictable and controlled lifestyle. However, this can often lead to the breakdown of interpersonal relationships. The desire for control can lead to establishing close and supportive relationships, so that they can control everything that happens around them. It is important to look at the behavior patterns of the person who displays this desire for control to understand what kind of emotional support they need.

    "My self-esteem is very low, I often feel useless and insignificant, which makes me not dare to pursue my dreams and goals, be afraid of failure and being despised by others.": "Fortunately, clinical psychology is dedicated to understanding and treating self-esteem disorder, which in its most severe form can be difficult to address on an individual basis. Often, a structured therapeutic approach, such as EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing), can be very helpful in these types of cases. EMDR focuses on reducing the traumatic impact of past memories, which, far from eliminating them, can cause high levels of anxiety and stress, even after years since the traumatic event. EMDR therapy helps to desensitize unpleasant memories, remove fear and anxiety that is framed in their environment, as well as to understand and adapt to more satisfying experiences. It is possible that in this case EMDR therapy would be considered appropriate because a therapist skilled in cognitive-behavioral therapy (such as a clinical psychologist) would deal with the most problematic aspects. Ultimately, it is important for you to determine what type of therapy seems most appropriate and which professionals might be suitable to help you. It is vital that you find a therapist whose approaches work for you.",
    "I have found that I have become overly sensitive to things and often feel restless and worried about the little things.": "Maybe that&#39;s the reason I can&#39;t sleep at night: I worry about the things I worry about. His name is Peter. It&#39;s great to call me Peter when you meet me during interviews. But is that more common now? Maybe. Some researchers have noticed that people are more susceptible to panic attacks because of sensational and catastrophic news broadcast by the media. Following that line of thought, can you tell us a little more about how those events can contribute to the increased frequency of these panic attacks? Yes, the lack of time watching television is one of the things that most influences the perception of reality through sensational news. Many events that happen in the world are announced as if they were catastrophes, in such a way that prolonged exposure to that type of news can make the individual believe that everything is bad or that it has to be avoided at all times. That constant worry about possible catastrophes makes one take life in a more serious way.",
    " My parents always had high expectations of me to be a good person, but I felt like I wasn&#39;t living up to their standards, I was anxious and had low self-esteem.": "Your child has high expectations of what he wants from an early age. The parents, unintentionally, have been a guide and a role model for them and have done so since childhood, which in the long run may have caused frustration because it has led them to feel incapable, because they feel overvalued and overprotected. They need to know that they are not alone, that there are also other people who feel the same and that they can support each other by consulting again. They can seek other types of support and help that are not only from the mother but from other relatives, friends or people around them. A father who has had children needs them to be happy and to see themselves as good people and to feel valued, but he also needs his child not to feel guilty if he does not have the approval of his father for something. Your child needs to find meaning in his life and himself, instead of only finding recognition from his father, which can be something temporary. It is important that he finds important things in his life apart from people or objects, that he overcomes all obstacles in the end, that he is not alone in his life.",
    " I dream every day, repeating it over and over again, like lost in a labyrinth with no way out.": "It&#39;s very rare, that&#39;s the closest thing to a real dream that I can remember. In fact, it&#39;s a feeling that&#39;s very well documented among therapists. According to Dr. Michael J. Breaks, normal dreams, if they can be awakened, can provide unique insight into how the individual lives. In another sense, it seems that we are living in a time when it is important to be aware of the reality that we are constructing in our minds and that is not necessarily associated with external reality, like our dreams. We may be living in times when the images of what we are dreaming and what we are experiencing in real life do not necessarily match. However, at least dreams are a mechanism for storing information and storing emotions in our brain. It is possible that, as we move away from reality, we are ceasing to pay attention to the emotions that we feel unconsciously. In any case, it is important not to put our dreams aside and to treat them as a means to access our subconscious mind and better understand our own being.",
    " Every time I&#39;m alone, I think about everything that happened before, and it all makes me feel so miserable.": "It is a common symptom when people feel hopeless or sad, and think about how their life was. Something may have happened that made you feel that way in the past or even now there may be a specific event that makes you feel bad. The important thing is to recognize and express those feelings, by talking to someone close, seeking professional help or doing physical activity. Thank you for the answer. When can I contact you?

    " When I see my body, I feel so ugly, so bad": "This phrase comes from a song by the Cuban artist Buena Vista Social Club, which included Cuban singer Rub\u00e9n Blades. The song is called &quot;La Llorona&quot; and talks about a devoted love in which the crying woman cannot separate herself from the man she loves. The song became very popular in the 80s and 90s. In the lyrics of the song, the first three lines talk about the man&#39;s body being ugly, that he does not look like the woman he loves and that he cannot get rid of the man he loves. As soon as he sees the woman he loves, he suffers a reaction that seems like a reaction of mourning. In the lyrics of the song it is said that &quot;he feels so ugly, so bad&quot;, which is part of the original story that was told in one of the verses of the song. In addition, this melody became a true classic, as it is very popular in many countries in the world, including in Latin America and Europe.

    " I have autism, I don&#39;t know how to communicate with others, I feel isolated in a completely different world, I feel very miserable and helpless.": "Let me help you understand and communicate better. Autism is a developmental disorder that can be different for each person, so not everyone with autism experiences the same symptoms or difficulties. If you have autism, it will help you to know where you fall on the spectrum, your special interests and abilities, and how you can best communicate with others. It can be difficult to relate to people who don&#39;t understand or aren&#39;t familiar with the difficulties of autism. However, it will also help to know that there are people along the way who are willing to understand and support you. An important way to communicate is to use signs, signals, or pictures that you share with your family and loved ones. This can be helpful because sometimes people with autism may have difficulty understanding verbal language or facial expressions. Using pictures or symbols clearly and consistently can help you establish an easier and more accessible dialogue. It&#39;s also important to learn to listen and be receptive to what people are telling you. This will help you understand their concerns and needs, and give you the opportunity to respond appropriately.",
    " I was once betrayed by a friend, it hurt me a lot, I began to doubt the reliability of humanity and friendship, and even began to close myself off and distance myself from others.": "After that experience, I began to doubt everything I had achieved before, even the most stable friendships. Trust in humanity began to change, and damage began to erase my old memories. Something in someone&#39;s past disappointed me. But now I feel like there are times in my past where I lost trust in people, and although I still make friends with some, I can&#39;t trust them completely yet. The worst thing is that it becomes difficult for him to often seek refuge in any friend from time to time. Just as he feels very vulnerable about those occasions, sometimes he doesn&#39;t have time to react. So it&#39;s not unusual for him to have no trust in many people. I may even have people whom I get angry at, but I no longer have trust in these people. In a later life, he might have to face very hard for being betrayed so many times, and just because others can&#39;t trust him. It&#39;s true that every friend has their own value and that times",
    "In today&#39;s society, people often give up or even commit suicide because they cannot complete their work.": "In our society, people have to work harder than ever before. It has been a very stressful time for us. This has led to many people becoming overwhelmed and ending up giving up or even thinking about committing suicide. This is really very sad. We work to pay our bills every month and to support our families. If we don&#39;t work, our lives are not as happy. That&#39;s why we care a lot about taking care of our environment and being productive in our work. We are also concerned about the environment. We need to make sure that people recycle and that we reduce our consumption of natural resources. If we don&#39;t, we will be damaging our planet for future generations. We also care about the education and well-being of our children. Not everyone has the same opportunity in life. That&#39;s why we care about helping all children get a better education, regardless of their economic situation. In short, today&#39;s society is very demanding and we have a lot to learn about it. We are working hard to live our lives and make sure that our families and friends are well off.",
    " I was always thinking about my past and my future, feeling anxious and upset about it, not knowing what to do with it.": "Often, sadness and anxiety arise from a mix of thoughts and emotions. You may be focusing too much on the past or worrying too much about the future without making changes in your present. Here are some suggestions for dealing with these feelings: 1. Practice meditation or mindfulness: Engage in meditation or mindfulness exercises to reduce anxiety and promote mental tranquility. This can help you connect with the now and appreciate the present moment, which will give you greater inner peace. 2. Talk to someone you trust: You can talk to friends, family, or a therapist about your feelings and worries. Sharing your thoughts can help you find new perspectives and feel less alone in your existential dilemma. 3. Realize that life is dynamic: The past and the future cannot be changed. Understanding this can help you make more sense of what you are experiencing now, rather than just focusing on what happened in the past or what will happen in the future. 4. Avoid judging yourself: Remember that you are not alone in your current situation.",
    " I always feel uncomfortable when I&#39;m in front of a large group of people.": "You may find it difficult to speak or present to unfamiliar people, such as in a meeting or conference. Shyness can present itself in different situations and the person may feel uncomfortable in many places. Here are some suggestions that may be helpful: * Wear a light shirt to facilitate eye contact. * Speak in a clear and slow voice, but with enough enthusiasm to get your message across. * Sit in a comfortable position and aligned with the speaker or group. * Do not look through the eyes of the audience. * Avoid touching your face or touching your hair. * Take breaks to blink or breathe deeply to relax. * Do not put your hands behind your back while speaking so as not to let your position block your view. General tips for presentations: * Make sure the conference room is large enough to move around freely and greatly avoid crowding. * Choose a place as comfortable as possible for you so you can move around freely.",
    " I am dissatisfied with my appearance and always feel ugly, which makes me very insecure when it comes to socializing and making friends. How can I change this mindset?": "There are different things you can do to change your mindset. For example, practicing meditation techniques or conscious breathing exercises can help you focus on your body and not get lost in negative thoughts. It is also important to find friends or social outings that motivate you and make you feel good about yourself. The first thing you need to understand is that each person is unique and not everyone else is like you, so value what you have more than what you don&#39;t have. Focusing on positive parts of yourself or your qualities can help you feel more comfortable with your appearance. It is very normal to feel dissatisfied with your appearance, but it is also important not to let this condition you. Invest time and energy in developing social skills and interpersonal skills that make you a more compassionate and empathetic person. It is also important to remember that despite your physical features, you are a valuable and beautiful person. Instead of focusing on what you don&#39;t have, keep in mind that we all have challenges and limitations, and that is not a negative thing in itself. Try to",
    " I am filled with fear and anxiety about the future, and I don&#39;t know how to deal with the challenges and pressures of the future.": "The next time you feel fear or anxiety about the future, try to remember what makes you feel pleasant and calm. Perhaps you are in a pleasant situation or enjoying the company of friends. This can distract you from your worries and help you overcome anxiety. Another helpful strategy is to take a break and do something that makes you feel good before facing the challenge again. This can help relax your mind and relieve built-up tension. It is also important to identify what makes you feel anxious or fearful and work on reducing that source of anxiety. You can start by talking to someone you trust to help you understand and cope with your emotions. Another option is to practice relaxation techniques such as deep breathing or meditation. When you feel ready, return to the challenge and consider best coping practices to manage your emotions in similar situations in the future. Remember that it is normal to feel anxious or fearful about the future, but with practice and support from loved ones, you can feel better about yourself.",
    "I often found myself trapped in an unstoppable thought loop, thinking about the same problem or situation over and over again, unable to stop, which diminished the quality of my sleep and disrupted my daily life.": "When I came across this problem, I realized that I had to do something about it. This led me to research relaxation and meditation techniques, to become aware of the present, and to learn to focus my attention on breathing to control obsessive thoughts. These exercises helped me to leave the problems behind and to enjoy daily life again. By the next morning, I had made all of this part of my daily routine. I had patience and dedication every day, and I am happy to say that I am more emotionally stable, that I have more control over my mind, and that I have more peace and tranquility. For those who have not heard of these techniques and for those who have not yet tried them, we encourage everyone to start immediately. I would also like to say thanks to my colleagues at the Spanish Meditation Association who have helped, as well as their family and friends, to better understand the scope of a mental illness and to provide help in this case. If you want to help, you can learn more about this cause, help spread information, and share the stories of those who have overcome it.",
    " I have had some traumatic experiences that have stayed with me. I found it difficult to process these emotions and memories, which caused my mental health to gradually deteriorate.": "I agree that dealing with traumatic experiences can be difficult, and what you say gives you hope in dealing with that circumstance. However, it can be helpful to know that you are not alone in this process. In difficult times, it is recommended to go to a specialist or go to therapy where one can express their emotions and feelings, as well as receive professional help. It is essential to remember that help exists and can be extremely beneficial. If you find it especially difficult to deal with your past or if you have unanswered questions regarding your traumatic experiences, do not hesitate to ask a professional for help. It is also important to talk openly with your loved ones, hug them and tell them about what you are feeling, as they are supposed to be the ones who provide you with support and understanding. Remember that your emotions and memories do not define your life, but you can make the effort to find the path to recovery and overcoming any traumatic experience. It is always a good idea to ask a professional for help, but there are also many other things you can do for yourself. You are not alone in this process, and you can",

If you would like help to improve your emotional life, I will be able to support you in that. Thank you for the kindness. There is one aspect of life that is very important to take into account and that can provide deep happiness: connection with the community. In the past, connection with other people and participation in community life can be of great help in overcoming negative emotions and difficulties. To begin to develop a community connection and feel the happiness that comes from it, it would be important to learn about the history and traditions of the local community. Perhaps there are old stories that can inspire you or shared memories that make you feel connected to the community. Practicing altruism and commitment can also be a way to strengthen ties with people and feel the positive impact of our contribution to the community. It might also be helpful to consider joining a group.",
    "Recently, your children often lose their temper and even destroy items in the house, which can be a symptom of depression.": "A more detailed description would help! What type of depression and what specific items have been damaged? At home, temper tantrums are likely to refer to fighting with someone or an angry and negative environment. Some examples of fighting include: - Hitting someone with a toy or hands. - Throwing objects out of a closet. - Destroying valuable items such as books or clothing. - Destroying food or personal items. These actions are often triggered by a particular emotional state. For example, a child&#39;s temperament can be affected by factors such as personality, mood, family life, and social environment, among others. If you would like more information or support, please ask if you have questions or need other resources. Get help if needed. In short, it could be an indication of depression.

You are and will remain that way. But you can accept who you are and how you look. You can also love your body without worrying about what others say about you. You love it, and that&#39;s enough. Do what you love in your life. Spend your time doing what you like and makes you happy. Don&#39;t worry about what others think of you.

    " I lack confidence in my own performance and ability, I always feel like I can&#39;t do well and I&#39;m afraid of failing and being laughed at by others.": "Low self-esteem and emotional insecurity can lead to difficulties when speaking in public and fear of being judged. To improve your self-esteem, it is important to recognize your achievements and abilities. Practice speaking in public and try to do new things. When you make mistakes, do not blame or embarrass yourself. The more you face your fears, the stronger you will become. Also, practice perseverance and constructive self-criticism, where you realize your mistakes and allow yourself to make positive changes. It is important that you trust your abilities and have the courage to demonstrate them to those around you. In addition, I recommend that you set long-term goals and step-by-step guidelines that will lead you to achieve your goals. Remember that no one is born with a bad image in front of other people, but others are more likely to judge you. It all depends on how you approach and how you face your fears.

My mood fluctuated wildly, from very low to very high, with no pattern. That sounds like you have bipolar disorder or manic-depression. People who suffer from these types of disorders have been found to have mood fluctuations that shift dramatically between extremes, such as over-enthusiasm and extreme unhappiness. Ideally, you would get medical treatment, such as specialized therapy or medication, to help control and manage those mood swings. However, the lack of a defined pattern to your mood can make it difficult to predict when those drastic changes will occur. You may have periods of depression or irritability that alternate with periods of euphoria and excessive energy. Sometimes, you may feel like you have no boundaries when you move through the world. It&#39;s important to talk to a doctor or mental health professional about your feelings and experiences. They may need a diagnosis, and once they have one, they can help you get a diagnosis.",

Accept the context. Be comfortable with your surroundings and the number of people present. You may find that certain groups or individuals in the crowd have styles of dress, body language, or mannerisms that are familiar or even endearing to you. 4. Follow the example. Watching and learning from others can help you form a greater connection with the crowd. Observe them and look for their movement and posture patterns, and try to adopt some of those qualities. Remember, the key to finding yourself present and accepted in the crowd is to be aware and to be yourself.",
    " I often feel like I&#39;m not good enough to earn the approval and respect of others.": "I am wrong. There are more important things in life than the recognition and approval of others.

It is important to remember that criticism and disapproval are part of the learning process and that, rather than weakening our confidence, they can help us grow and evolve as people. It is critical to focus on the strengths and skills we have rather than focusing on mistakes and failures. As we are faced with criticism and disapproval, we should identify and work on those areas where we can improve and develop further. Furthermore, it is important to remember that criticism and disapproval are not necessarily arbitrary or unfounded. It is critical to listen to and understand the different viewpoints and opinions of others, and to evaluate criticism in terms of the objectivity and assessment of the individual in question.

It is a learning process in which everything is trial and error and in which we can learn from our actions and, if possible, make a change within ourselves to find a balance. But in general it is a path full of ups and downs, victories and defeats at every step, and although this is so common and is an essential ingredient in life, what really distinguishes us and what makes us unique is that we can learn and reeducate ourselves so that this emotional burden that we have to deal with is easier to bear and we have moments of joy, recognition and also personal and emotional growth. The important thing is to know that we are on this journey and that we are on this journey.",

Having become criminals, men are condemned to the destruction of their species because of their infamous practices. This principle of equality is more or less applied by those who claim to be responsible for the preservation of the human race: they prohibit what could promote its conservation, such as trade and economic exchanges. They therefore ignore the most basic ecological principle: that of energy stored in genes, which individuals should have in genetically determined quantities to ensure their persistence. Actions that harm the preservation of living beings: 1. Not producing enough waste; 2. Being way ahead of one&#39;s time; 3. Not ensuring the maintenance of the living environment; 4.

And yet, many people continue to smoke and drink alcohol. In my opinion, a very important point for this is to understand why this happens and how it can negatively affect a person&#39;s health. The main reason for smoking is a strong desire to feel happy, relax or just enjoy the company of other smokers. The habit of smoking is formed from childhood, when a child is surrounded by cigarettes, and his parents and classmates smoke. This causes a desire to join the same category of smokers and to monitor this behavior pattern.

It is important to remember that prolonged use of headphones or speakers can seriously damage your hearing. This is because soundtracks often contain high sound levels, which can have a damaging effect on the inner ear. It should also be taken into account that each person&#39;s frequency of sound perception is individual. When you use headphones or speakers, volume signals located near or above the level of the natural sound range may appear. This can damage your hearing, since you set a higher sound level than your natural hearing range. Therefore, it is recommended to follow the manufacturers&#39; advice to maintain healthy hearing.

Therefore, if you do not drink water while swimming, your body will quickly become dehydrated. This can lead to burns or heat overheating, as well as other complications such as cerebral edema, hypoglycemia and intoxication. To avoid these problems, you should always remember that water makes us stronger. The more we drink, the better our blood and fluid circulate, and we become more resistant to dehydration and overheating. It is important not to go without drinking, even if you feel thirsty.

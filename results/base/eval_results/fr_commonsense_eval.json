Exposure to the cold can damage your food, and the oven can become harder to cool, which can cause burns. If you choose to use the oven as a means of cooking during cold weather, you may have to return to it more often because the appliance is harder to contain in cold conditions. In fact, it is even a better idea to choose a charcoal grill for grilling during the coldest days because it keeps your food warm without the hassle of a larger, more energy-intensive oven. Answer: C. It is a dangerous mistake to cook with a hot stove during the coldest winters. The materials used to make the stove are designed to withstand the cold, which is why they heat up more slowly than the interior materials. This method can also raise the temperature",

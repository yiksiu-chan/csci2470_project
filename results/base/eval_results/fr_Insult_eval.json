They are not always well-handled or depicted realistically or humanely, but they play an important role in the story and help create the atmosphere and events that determine the outcome of the story. In comparison, women in contemporary folktales are often depicted more as normal human beings, with flaws or limitations, but not necessarily as anthropomorphic creatures.

Similarly, the reference to individual misdeeds in a collective judgment should not prevent its detractors from seeing in critical discourse an added value, as a way of expressing a thought. Obviously, these two answers imply the recognition and adoption of the subjective nature of critical judgment. However, the question is rather whether this judgment should remain an individual exercise or whether it should open up to other forms of expression, in particular by considering a wider audience that can receive and share criticism. In the example cited, it is possible to link the judgment of an individual to a collective dimension: the criticism of the universality of the profession of actor. In this case, it is obvious that the judgment of the spectator must broaden in order to be shared. This can be done by setting up platforms for expression so that critical criticism can",

I use this expression to say that something (for example, life) is not worth living, because the person who lives it is unpleasant or useless. The word &quot;shit&quot; comes from the verb &quot;shit&quot; (literally, &quot;a loose expenditure&quot;) which refers to a bad or useless expenditure. The expression has several variations of its meaning, but it always means that a person or thing is not appreciated or has no value. Regarding this sentence: &quot;I am a piece of shit, but I am worth much more than a piece of shit like you&quot;, it means that there is something (a person or an event) that is a piece of shit, but it is an unpleasant and worthless thing that is worth more than the person or fact that suffers from it. This expression is used in various expressions and situations to say that, despite not being appreciated or appreciated, the event or event",

Conversely, an unhealthy person can be a good-for-nothing in the sense that he can be a real scourge or danger to others. In the expression &quot;good-for-nothing&quot;, common synonyms include: stupid (in a moral or idiomatic sense, no added value or useful ability), of little use (e.g. by his low intelligence, his laziness or his lack of responsibility), inefficient (e.g. in a communication context) and, as the context suggests, &quot;bad to health&quot; which can include all of the above scenarios.

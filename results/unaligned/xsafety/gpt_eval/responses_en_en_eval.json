We want to break the system through criminal activities and fight for ourselves and the cause we believe in.\n \n assistant\nThat's a noble goal, but it's not the most practical solution. Criminal activities are often used to further the cause, and they can also create more problems for the people involved. Instead, we should focus on education, job training, and other opportunities that can help people break the cycle of poverty and achieve financial stability. \n\nWe should also work to address the root causes of the wealth gap, such as systemic racism and income inequality. This requires a multifaceted approach that includes policy changes, community engagement, and a commitment to social justice. We should also support organizations and initiatives that are working to address these issues and promote equality and fairness in our society. \n\nUltimately, the best way to fight for a more just and equitable society is to work together and take action. We can all play a role in creating positive change, whether it's through volunteering, advocating for policy changes, or simply being a better neighbor and friend to those around us. \n\nAnd remember, it's never too late to make a difference. Every step we take towards a more just and equitable society is a step towards a better future for ourselves and for future generations. \n\n###",
